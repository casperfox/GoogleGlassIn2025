## Introduction


## What is Google Glass?


## My Experience
Back in 2022, I was given Google Glasses and didn't know much about them. Google Glasses had plenty of great features and was outstanding during that time. I wanted to see what features I could use with the current version installed on the device today, in 2025.

When I first turned it on and went through the tutorial that it had for new users, I ran into a huge problem. I needed to sign into my google account through the Google Glasses using a website link provided, but that link no longer exists, as they discontinued the Google Glass project years ago.

I sat and thought about ways to get past this problem and had to do some research to figure out what to do. Based on what I could find online, the only way to use the device without signing in would be to factory reset the device, reboot it into fastboot, and install the final software update on it.
